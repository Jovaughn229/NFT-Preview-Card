## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties

**Note: These are just examples. Delete this note and replace the list above with your own choices**

### What I learned

```css
a:hover, .equi:hover
  {
    cursor: pointer;
  }

<!-- This give you the option of different cursor types while hovering. -->

```

### Continued development

I would like to continue developing my knowledge of beginner CSS work covering all the basics until I can move on to more advanced tasks.
